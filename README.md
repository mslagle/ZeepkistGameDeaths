# ZeepkistGameDeaths

Zeepkist Game Deaths is a mod that replicates other game deaths when you crash.  Currently it supports the following game deaths:

* Dark Souls
* GTA
* Mortal Kombat
* Scary

## How to Change the Death

Open the settings for zeepkist.  Goto the mods tab and scroll down until you see the settings for the mod.  There you can scroll to the death scene you want or disable the mod. 

## Add a Custom Death

Inside the mod folder, you can create your own custom death image and sound.  To do so, add files named custom.[number].mp3 and custom.[number].png.  The index number allows to add multiple custom selections, which will be randomly selected when your zeep person dies.

### Example
- custom.1.png
- custom.1.mp3
- custom.2.png
- custom.2.mp3
